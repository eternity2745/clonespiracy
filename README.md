### Project Description
Clonespiracy is a groundbreaking (and totally unnecessary) AI-powered app designed to validate one of Kerala‚Äôs most suspiciously accurate proverbs: "Oraale pole ezhu per ondaavum" (There are seven people in the world who look alike). Through the use of face analysis, roast generation, and lookalike detection, Clonespiracy seeks to find your visual duplicates ‚Äî and then gently (or savagely) roast you for being just another copy in the simulation.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people walk around believing they‚Äôre one of a kind. Some even think they‚Äôre "built different." This delusional sense of uniqueness threatens the delicate balance of roast culture, meme production, and clone-based conspiracy theories. Clearly, the world needs a tool to shatter egos and confirm suspicions that we‚Äôre all just Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V‚Äôd by the universe.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Clonespiracy ‚Äî the completely unnecessary yet irresistibly fun app that:
Scans your face using AI 
Finds your visual duplicates aka "Clone Squad" 
Generates brutally funny roasts 
Gives you a ‚ÄúClone Rank‚Äù and similarity score
And even lets you talk to your AI clone like a¬†confused¬†mirror
